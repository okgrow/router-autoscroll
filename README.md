Autoscroll for Meteor
==========================

An [Iron Router](https://atmospherejs.com/iron/router) and [Flow Router](https://atmospherejs.com/kadira/flow-router) enhancement that improves navigation for pages that have more than one screen-full of content.
It causes the page to scroll to the right place after changing routes (which people are often surprised to find doesn't happen by default).

"The right place" is:

1. The previous position if we're returning via the back button, or
2. The element whose id is specified in the URL hash (if present), or
3. The top of page otherwise

Demo Sites
==========

You can see the behavior of each of the example sites at:

Why?
----

In The Old Daysâ„¢ when you navigated to a new page the browser would unload the current page, load the new page, and position the viewport to the top of the page.
If the link had an anchor/hash (e.g. `#something`) the browser would scroll down to the top of the element with that id.

When changing routes using Iron Router the browser doesn't technically load a new page,
it just changes content in the existing page (as far as the browser is concerned) so it doesn't scroll to the top.
The viewport stays in the same place it was already.
So when navigating from a page that's scrolled down already this feels to the user like navigating to a new page and being scrolled partway down, which feels unnatural.

Installation
----------

`meteor add okgrow:router-autoscroll`


Configuration
-----------

The animation speed defaults to 200 ms.
To change this use:

``` javascript
IronRouterAutoscroll.animationDuration = 100;
```

To navigate to a route and explicitly maintain scroll position, pass
`maintainScroll=1` in the hash:

Example (for `iron:router`):

```javascript
Router.go('newRoute', {}, {
  query: {q: 'newQuery'},
  hash: 'maintainScroll=1'
});
```

Hot Code Push
-----------

The scroll position will be restored after a hot code push.

Hot code pushes actually do a `window.location.reload()`, breaking
from the single-page-app (SPA) paradigm, but we use the HotCodePush
module to set up the saving/restoring of scroll position.

Known issues
------------

There are a few edge cases which aren't supported yet (around navigation using the back button and pages which load dynamic content after the route change).
PR's are welcome.

The `appcache` package changes the behavior of URL navigation, and this package
does not initialize when it detects it in your app.

Other notes
---------------

This package enhances Iron Router, or Flow Router, whichever it detects, but it
does not force an install of either package since its dependency is declared as `{weak: true}`.
